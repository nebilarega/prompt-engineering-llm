## Business objective

Large Language Models coupled with multiple AI capabilities are able to generate images and text, and also approach/achieve human level performance on a number of tasks. The world is going through a revolution in art (DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagine, etc.), science (AlphaFold), medicine, and other key areas, and this approach is playing a role in this revolution.
.
In-context learning, popularized by the team behind the GPT-3 LLM, brought a new revolution for using LLMs in many tasks that the LLM was not originally not trained for. This stands in contrast to the usual fine-tuning that used to be required to equip AI models to improve performance in tasks they were not trained for.

With in-context learning, LLMs are able to constantly adjust their performance on a task depending on the prompt - from structured input that can be considered partly a few-shot training and partly a test input. This has opened up many applications.

This weekâ€™s challenge is to systematically explore strategies that help generate prompts for LLMs to extract relevant entities from job descriptions and also to classify web pages given only a few examples of human scores. You will be also required to compare responses and accuracies of multiple LLM models for given prompts.

## Project Overview

A client has a system that collects news artifacts from web pages, tweets, facebook posts, etc. The client is interested in scoring a given new artifact against a topic. The client has hired experts to score a few of these news items in the range from 0 to 10; a score of 0 means the news item is totally NOT relevant while a score of 10 means the news item is very relevant. The range of results between 0 and 10 signifies the degree of relevance of the news item to the topic. The client wants to explore how useful existing LLMs such as GPT-3 are for this task. You are hired as a consultant to explore the efficiency of GPT3-like LLMs to this task. If your recommendation is positive, you must demonstrate that your strategies to design prompts are reproducible and produce a consistent result.
